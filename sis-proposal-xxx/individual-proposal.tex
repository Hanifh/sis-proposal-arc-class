(individual part)

Specific aims need to be concrete enough, so that it is clear what will be the expected outcomes of this work. You also need a reasonable scope that you could finish in this semester. For APC-focus group, the specific aims might be that you replicate a previous approach as baseline and do better in a component (such as the vision system). For the students who will use the 3 mobile manipulators, developing an additional module with a few tasks like our lab will be good. Each task could be a specific aim.

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific Aim 1.
\item Specific Aim 2.
\end{itemize}

\section{APPROACH}

(individual part)

This section should include the methods that you will need in order to reach the specific aims. You could include how you will implement your software/hardware, the design of the algorithms. Some preliminary results will be helpful as well. 

You may also state what experiments you will carry out to convince the readers that you reach the specific aims.

\section{SCHEDULE AND TEAM COLLABORATION}

(individual part)

In this section you should write a estimated timeline of your project. This schedule will be very crucial to keep up progress for your project. If you are in a team, you're encouraged to add other team members' on the timeline. It will better show the coordination of your team.
